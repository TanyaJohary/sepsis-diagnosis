MCL	1	Red	#ff0000	8	ARG1	9606.ENSP00000349446	Arginase-1; Key element of the urea cycle converting L-arginine to urea and L-ornithine, which is further metabolized into metabolites proline and polyamides that drive collagen synthesis and bioenergetic pathways critical for cell proliferation, respectively; the urea cycle takes place primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys. Belongs to the arginase family.
MCL	1	Red	#ff0000	8	BCL2	9606.ENSP00000381185	Apoptosis regulator Bcl-2; Suppresses apoptosis in a variety of cell systems including factor-dependent lymphohematopoietic and neural cells. Regulates cell death by controlling the mitochondrial membrane permeability. Appears to function in a feedback loop system with caspases. Inhibits caspase activity either by preventing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and/or by binding to the apoptosis-activating factor (APAF-1). May attenuate inflammation by impairing NLRP1-inflammasome activation, hence CASP1 activation and IL1B release.
MCL	1	Red	#ff0000	8	GATA3	9606.ENSP00000368632	Trans-acting T-cell-specific transcription factor GATA-3; Transcriptional activator which binds to the enhancer of the T-cell receptor alpha and delta genes. Binds to the consensus sequence 5'-AGATAG-3'. Required for the T-helper 2 (Th2) differentiation process following immune and inflammatory responses.
MCL	1	Red	#ff0000	8	IL10	9606.ENSP00000412237	Interleukin-10; Major immune regulatory cytokine that acts on many cells of the immune system where it has profound anti-inflammatory functions, limiting excessive tissue disruption caused by inflammation. Mechanistically, IL10 binds to its heterotetrameric receptor comprising IL10RA and IL10RB leading to JAK1 and STAT2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3. In turn, STAT3 translocates to the nucleus where it drives expression of anti-inflammatory mediators. Targets antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and monocytes and inhibits their release of pro- inflammatory cytokines i [...] 
MCL	1	Red	#ff0000	8	IL1R2	9606.ENSP00000330959	Interleukin-1 receptor type 2, membrane form; Non-signaling receptor for IL1A, IL1B and IL1RN. Reduces IL1B activities. Serves as a decoy receptor by competetive binding to IL1B and preventing its binding to IL1R1. Also modulates cellular response through non-signaling association with IL1RAP after binding to IL1B. IL1R2 (membrane and secreted forms) preferentially binds IL1B and poorly IL1A and IL1RN. The secreted IL1R2 recruits secreted IL1RAP with high affinity; this complex formation may be the dominant mechanism for neutralization of IL1B by secreted/soluble receptors.
MCL	1	Red	#ff0000	8	MAPK14	9606.ENSP00000229795	Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14; Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. MAPK14 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are a [...] 
MCL	1	Red	#ff0000	8	MMP9	9606.ENSP00000361405	67 kDa matrix metalloproteinase-9; May play an essential role in local proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and in leukocyte migration. Could play a role in bone osteoclastic resorption. Cleaves KiSS1 at a Gly-|-Leu bond. Cleaves type IV and type V collagen into large C-terminal three quarter fragments and shorter N-terminal one quarter fragments. Degrades fibronectin but not laminin or Pz-peptide. Belongs to the peptidase M10A family.
MCL	1	Red	#ff0000	8	SOCS3	9606.ENSP00000330341	Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; SOCS family proteins form part of a classical negative feedback system that regulates cytokine signal transduction. SOCS3 is involved in negative regulation of cytokines that signal through the JAK/STAT pathway. Inhibits cytokine signal transduction by binding to tyrosine kinase receptors including gp130, LIF, erythropoietin, insulin, IL12, GCSF and leptin receptors. Binding to JAK2 inhibits its kinase activity. Suppresses fetal liver erythropoiesis. Regulates onset and maintenance of allergic responses mediated by T-helper type 2 cells. Regulates IL [...] 
MCL	2	Green	#a3ff65	4	C3AR1	9606.ENSP00000302079	C3a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor; Receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptide anaphylatoxin C3a. This receptor stimulates chemotaxis, granule enzyme release and superoxide anion production; Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
MCL	2	Green	#a3ff65	4	CD177	9606.ENSP00000479536	CD177 antigen; In association with beta-2 integrin heterodimer ITGAM/CD11b and ITGB2/CD18, mediates activation of TNF-alpha primed neutrophils including degranulation and superoxide production. In addition, by preventing beta-2 integrin internalization and attenuating chemokine signaling favors adhesion over migration. Heterophilic interaction with PECAM1 on endothelial cells plays a role in neutrophil transendothelial migration in vitro. However, appears to be dispensable for neutrophil recruitment caused by bacterial infection in vivo. Acts as a receptor for the mature form of protea [...] 
MCL	2	Green	#a3ff65	4	FCGR1A	9606.ENSP00000358165	High affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc receptor I; High affinity receptor for the Fc region of immunoglobulins gamma. Functions in both innate and adaptive immune responses.
MCL	2	Green	#a3ff65	4	ITGAM	9606.ENSP00000496959	Integrin alpha-M; Integrin ITGAM/ITGB2 is implicated in various adhesive interactions of monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes as well as in mediating the uptake of complement-coated particles and pathogens. It is identical with CR-3, the receptor for the iC3b fragment of the third complement component. It probably recognizes the R-G-D peptide in C3b. Integrin ITGAM/ITGB2 is also a receptor for fibrinogen, factor X and ICAM1. It recognizes P1 and P2 peptides of fibrinogen gamma chain. Regulates neutrophil migration. In association with beta subunit ITGB2/CD18, required for CD177-PRTN [...]

Its proinflammatory activity involves recruitment of leukocytes, promotion of cytokine and chemokine production, and regulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration. Acts as an alarmin or a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and stimulates innate immune cells via binding to receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGER). Binding to AGER activates the MAP-kinase and NF- kappa-B signaling pathways leadi [...]
