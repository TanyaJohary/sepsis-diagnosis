    "We used peripheral whole blood obtained with the PaxGene system at the time of admission to the ICU, i.e., 12 hours after trauma, for transcriptome analysis and monitored clinically the sequence of events from the admission to the ICU, to the very onset of sepsis and finally to the full development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Study protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding ethics, patient recruitment, logistics in sample acquisition and storage, microarray experiments, data analysis and data management have been developed and provided for a high feasibility and reproducibility of the investigations.Group S (Sepsis): 34 patients.Group N (Non-sepsis): 36 patients.\n",
