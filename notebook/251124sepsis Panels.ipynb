    "### Challenges in Sepsis Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing of Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gene expression changes dynamically over time, making it difficult to define an exact stage of disease based on transcriptomics.\n",
    "The “moment in time” of sample collection may not align with disease progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Heterogeneity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variation in populations, sample processing, and bioinformatics analyses affects reproducibility and generalizability.\n",
    "Public datasets help improve robustness but require harmonization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical Translation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite promising transcriptomic data, clinical translation is slow due to:\n",
    "Cost of large-scale validation studies.\n",
    "Lack of calibration for clinical decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Genomic Storm and Heterogeneity in Sepsis\n",
    "\n",
    "Genomic Storm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sepsis triggers a \"genomic storm,\" where both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are expressed simultaneously.\n",
    "This dysregulated immune response can lead to life-threatening organ dysfunction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneity:\n",
    "Gene expression studies reveal significant variability in sepsis due to factors such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Host parameters (e.g., genomic variation, comorbidities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Source of infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage of illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variability has been a major challenge in clinical trials and therapeutic model development.\n",
