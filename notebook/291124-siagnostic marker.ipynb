    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Thymic Atrophy and Reduced T-Cell Output:\n",
    "\n",

    "Diagnostic and Prognostic Relevance:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Prognostic Value:The degree of thymic atrophy and ETP depletion correlated with immune recovery, suggesting potential prognostic value in monitoring sepsis progression and recovery.\n",
    "\n",
