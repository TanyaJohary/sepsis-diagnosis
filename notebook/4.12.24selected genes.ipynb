    "\n",
    "## 3. Adaptive Immune Pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Genes: HLA-DR, PDCD1 (PD-1), IL10, GATA3, CCR7, CCR8, BCL2.\n",

    "\n",
    "Key Genes: C3AR1, C5AR1, S100A8/S100A9, VCAM1, ICAM1, PTX3.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Key Genes: VCAM1, ICAM1, HIF1 (HIF1A), TNF, IL1B, MMP8, MMP9, CX3CR1.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Key Genes: P2RX7, CD177, OLFM4, MMP8, MMP9, S100A8/S100A9, NLRP3.CEACAM4\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Overproduction of ROS damages lipids, proteins, and DNA, exacerbating tissue injury.\n",

    "## 7. Hypoxia and Metabolic Pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Genes: HIF1 (HIF1A), ARG1, LCN2, IL10, MAPK14, PTX3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Hypoxia-induced metabolic shifts (e.g., glycolysis) and mitochondrial dysfunction impair energy production and worsen organ failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Apoptosis and Cell Death Pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Genes: BCL2, TNFSF10 (TRAIL), NLRP3, P2RX7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Excessive apoptosis (e.g., lymphocyte death) and inflammatory cell death (e.g., pyroptosis) weaken immune defenses and increase tissue damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Complement Activation Pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Genes: C3AR1, C5AR1, PTX3, LBP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Amplifies inflammation and opsonization but contributes to tissue damage and endothelial dysfunction when dysregulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Organ-Specific Pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Genes: LCN2, PTX3, ARG1, HIF1 (HIF1A), MMP9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Impaired organ function (e.g., kidneys, liver, heart, lungs) due to tissue hypoxia, inflammation, and vascular injury.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Regulation Pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Genes: SOCS3, HIF1 (HIF1A), GATA3, MYD88.\n",
    "Role: Sepsis-induced epigenetic changes and transcriptional reprogramming alter immune and inflammatory responses.\n",
