    "\t\t\t\t\n",
    "1. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The study aims to identify early genetic markers for sepsis by examining the expression of TLR pathway genes in critically ill SIRS patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential Gene Expression:A total of 2,190 unique genes were identified as differentially expressed between the \"preseptic SIRS\" and \"uninfected SIRS\" groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "36 TLR-related genes were annotated, with 28 showing increased expression and 8 showing decreased expression in preseptic patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant TLR Genes:\n",
    "TLR genes such as TLR-1, TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-7, and TLR-8 were differentially expressed.\n",
    "TLR-4 (recognizing gram-negative bacteria) and TLR-5 (responding to bacterial flagellin) had notable upregulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Associated Pathway Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal Transduction Genes:Genes involved in the MyD88-dependent signaling cascade (e.g., MAPK14, IRAK2, IRAK4) were upregulated.\n",
    "Genes in the PI3K pathway, which provides counter-regulation to inflammation, also showed differential expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory Molecules:Inhibitors like NF-κBIA and NF-κBIZ, which regulate inflammation, were also upregulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing of Expression:Differential expression of these genes was observed up to 24 hours before clinical diagnosis of sepsis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Population:\n",
    "90 critically ill trauma patients with SIRS:\n",
    "45 who progressed to sepsis (preseptic SIRS).\n",
