    "\n",
    "Organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**PATHOGEN DETECTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Multiplex PCR for pathogen detection was introduced in 2006 with the SeptiFast (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA) technology (4) and with several follow-on technologies, such as the Iridica system (Abbott, Chicago, IL) (18) and T2 Biosystems (Lexington, MA) (19). This approach allows physicians to detect common bloodstream pathogens in the span of a few hours, representing a substantial improvement over the 􏰅8 h for work-up from positive blood cultures and the at least 24 h required for detection of pathogens using traditional blood culture and biochemical identification  .\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "2.Most recently, next-generation sequencing from whole blood has been described using cell-free DNA (20, 21). A recent study demonstrated 93.7% agreement for next-generation sequencing from cell-free DNA with blood culture in patients with suspected sepsis (22). Most sequencing tests still require more than 24 h from sample collection to result report but offer hypothesis-free testing with good sensitivity compared to that of multiplex PCR. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "**SINGLE-PROTEIN OR METABOLIC BIOMARKERS** \n",
    "\n",
    "1.**Lactic acid**, a marker of cellular hypoperfusion, is nonspecific for infection and has limited diagnostic accuracy as an independent marker. However, use of lactic acid measurements in serum to guide resuscitation has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with septic shock . Lactate is generally used as a prognostic marker in cases of sepsis, and its measurement is mandated as part of the SEP-1 bundle within 3 h after suspicion of sepsis. Lactate values of 􏰅2 mmol/liter identify a patient population at high risk for mortality that warrants further clinical evaluation. \n",
    "2.**C-reactive protein (CRP)** is an acute phase reactant that is elevated in a variety of inflammatory states and has been studied as both a diagnostic and prognostic tool in sepsis. Several noninfectious conditions can cause an elevated CRP, so its specificity for infections is low.\t\n",
    "3.**Procalcitonin (PCT)** is perhaps the most-studied biomarker of sepsis over the past 10 to 15 years and is available in several FDA-cleared formats. PCT is the prohormone of calcitonin; it is made constitutively and released into the blood in conditions of systemic inflammation, particularly those stemming from bacterial infection.A systematic review of the literature has argued that PCT has limited diagnostic accuracy to distinguish sepsis from noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the critically ill (28).\n",
    "PCT may play an additional role as a prognostic marker in patients with sepsis. While a single PCT value at presentation has not shown substantial prognostic value (34), multiple studies have demonstrated that PCT can aid in assessing the risk of mortality when measured serially (35–37). PCT has received FDA clearance for assessing the risk of progression to severe sepsis and septic shock in the critically ill and assessing 28-day all-cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock, when measured serially over several days.\t\t\n",
    "4.Proadrenomedullin and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) are emerging prognostic biomarkers in patients with sepsis. Proadrenomedullin has shown superior prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis or septic shock compared to that of lactic acid, CRP, procalcitonin, and severity scores, including SOFA, simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), but is not yet approved for clinical use.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",

    "**TRANSCRIPTOMICS IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF INFECTIONS** \n",
    "\n",
    " 1.multi-mRNA panel consists of both its component mRNA variables and the mathematical algorithm that integrates those mRNAs into a diagnostic score. Only two transcriptomic sepsis scores, the SeptiScore and the Sepsis MetaScore, have been validated in independent cohorts using a locked algorithm. \n",
    "The SeptiScore is the continuous output of a four-mRNA **(CEACAM4, LAMP1, PLA2G7, and PLAC8)** test called SeptiCyte Lab. The test is currently being commercialized (Immunexpress, Seattle, WA), and a 4- to 6-h turnaround open-pipetting version of the test has received FDA clearance as an aid to differentiate infection-positive sepsis from infection-negative systemic inflammation in patients suspected of sepsis on their first day of ICU admission. \n",
    "The Sepsis MetaScore is based on expression levels of 11 host mRNAs **(CEACAM1, ZDHHC19, C9orf95/NMRK1, GNA15, BATF, C3AR1, KIAA1370, TGFBI, MTCH1, RPGRIP1, and HLA-DPB1)** and was discovered across publicly available microarray data from n 􏰆 663 patients across 9 clinical cohorts\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major area of emphasis in transcriptomics is in differentiating bacterial and viral infections. Here again, many scores have been proposed, but few have been externally validated. Sweeney et al. discovered a 7-mRNA “bacterial/viral metascore”that distinguished bacterial from viral infections .\n",
