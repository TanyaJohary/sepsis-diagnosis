    "# Dataset description: GSE69063\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset GSE69063 comprises gene expression profiles obtained from peripheral blood samples of patients experiencing anaphylaxis, trauma, sepsis, and healthy controls. The samples were collected as part of a study designed to investigate the gene expression patterns associated with these four disease phenotypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, samples specifically related to sepsis patients and Healthy controls were extracted to identify gene expression changes .For the analysis, the dataset was separated based on the timeline (T0, T1, and T2) to assess temporal changes in gene expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The samples were collected at three different time points:\n",
    "\n",
    "**T0**: At the time of emergency department (ED) arrival.\n",
    "(T0_sepsis_labeledGSE69063.csv) -> healthy control 33 and sepsis 19 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**T1**: One hour after ED arrival.\n",
    "(T1_sepsis_labeledGSE69063.csv) -> healthy control 33 and sepsis 20 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**T2**: Three hours after ED arrival.\n",
    "(T2_sepsis_labeledGSE69063.csv) -> healthy control 33 and sepsis 18 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presented-genes: 53\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing-genes : FCGR1A, IFNA1\n",
    "\n",
    "First we analyzed the T2 timeline which is 3 hours after a patient's ED arrival. (T2_sepsis_labeledGSE69063.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a random forest model applied to the dataset by considering the target label as a factor.(RF-T2factorGSE69063code.R)\n",
    "\n",
    "100 random splits are done. The result is saved in a csv file(repeated_splits_metrics.csv).\n",

    "NPV    0.9682143\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCC**: 0.944 — Strong agreement between predictions and actual outcomes, even for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1**: 0.951 — Excellent balance between precision and recall, showing high-quality predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AUC**: 1.000 — Perfect ability to distinguish between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TPR** (Sensitivity): 0.923 — High accuracy in identifying true positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TNR** (Specificity): 1.000 — Perfect accuracy in identifying true negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PPV** (Precision for Positives): 1.000 — All positive predictions are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NPV** (Precision for Negatives): 0.968 — Strong ability to predict negatives accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model shows near-perfect performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Feature Removal Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature removal plot provides insights into the importance of individual features (genes) in contributing to the model's performance. The x-axis represents the MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient), and the y-axis lists the features (genes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of removing individual features and observing the impact on metrics highlight the importance of different genes for predictions.The results has been saved in (feature_removal_results.csv) and here is the plot for impact for feature removal on MCC:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Important Genes (TOP of the Plot)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "These genes cause the largest drop in performance (MCC) when removed, indicating they are critical for the model’s predictions.(**NOTCH1, S100A12, IL1B, ARG1, GATA3**).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Least Important Genes (Bottom of the Plot)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "These genes cause the smallest drop in performance, meaning their contribution is minimal or redundant in the model.(**CD14, TLR4, IFNB1, CX3CR1, CRP**)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moderately Important Genes (Middle of the Plot)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "These genes cause a moderate drop in performance, suggesting they are important but somewhat redundant or less critical than the top genes.(**CALCA, MAPK14, LCN2, IL10, PTX3**)\n",

    "The model's performance under increasing levels of noise (as seen in the plot) shows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Moderate Noise (Noise Levels 10–20):Metrics degrade slightly but remain strong, reflecting robustness to minor data disruptions.\n",
