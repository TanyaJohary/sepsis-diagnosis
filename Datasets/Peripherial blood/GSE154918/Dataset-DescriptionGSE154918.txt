Dataset Description: GSE154918
This dataset, publicly available on GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), is titled "RNA-seq analysis of blood from sepsis patients and healthy controls". It features RNA sequencing data collected from peripheral blood samples of patients, enabling the study of gene expression changes between various patient groups. The study aimed to identify distinct transcriptional signatures associated with the following groups:
* Healthy control (Hlty)
* Uncomplicated infection (Inf1_P)
* Sepsis (Seps_P)
* Septic shock (Shock_P)
* Follow-up of sepsis (Seps_FU)
* Follow-up of septic shock (Shock_FU)
The RNA-seq data were generated using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. 
Data Processing: In this analysis, the primary focus was on the sepsis and healthy control groups, along with the septic shock group for comparative studies. The following subsets of the data were created:
1. Sepsis vs. Healthy Control: A subset was created to focus on the transcriptional differences between sepsis patients and healthy controls. 
(sepsis_only_labeled) -> 40 healthy and 20 sepsis samples.
2. Sepsis vs. Septic Shock and Healthy control: Another subset was created to explore the differences in gene expression between sepsis and septic shock patients.
(sepsis_shock_labeled) -> 40 healthy , 20 sepsis and 19 septic shock samples. 
3. Septic Shock vs. Healthy Control: This subset compares septic shock patients with healthy controls to identify unique gene expression patterns associated with the most severe cases.
(shock_only_labeled) ->  40 healthy and 19 septic shock.
4. Septic and Healthy control but here consider all the septic shock and sepsis patients as sepsis.
(all_sepsis_labeled) -> 40 healthy and 30 sepsis patients samples.




These subsets were prepared by filtering the status.ch1 column of the dataset based on the corresponding group identifiers (Hlty, Seps_P, and Shock_P). Data was normalized by Deseq2 in the database.
This processing enables the application of machine learning methods to analyze gene expression differences and test the effectiveness of identified genetic signatures in diagnosing and distinguishing these conditions.
