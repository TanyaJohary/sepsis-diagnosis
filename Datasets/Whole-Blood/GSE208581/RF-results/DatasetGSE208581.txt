Dataset Description: GSE208581
The dataset GSE208581 comprises gene expression profiles obtained from peripheral blood samples of patients who underwent major surgery. The study aimed to investigate the gene expression patterns associated with different postoperative outcomes, specifically focusing on the development of sepsis.
Sample Groups:
The samples are categorized into four distinct groups based on the patients' postoperative outcomes:
1. sep+: Patients who developed postoperative infection leading to sepsis.
2. SIR+: Patients who experienced a non-infectious systemic inflammatory response.
3. UInf+: Patients who developed an uncomplicated postoperative infection.
4. SIR-: Patients who had an uncomplicated postoperative course without significant inflammatory response.
Data Analysis:
For the analysis, samples specifically related to sepsis patients (Sepsis+) and those with an uncomplicated postoperative course (SIRS-) were extracted to identify gene expression changes associated with sepsis development.

I used the filtered_sepsis_dataGSE208581 dataset to apply Random forest which is for sepsis patients and Patients who had an uncomplicated postoperative course without significant inflammatory response(SIRS-) as control.
The dataset contains: [187 rows, 55 columns].


Here is the code that is used for both held-out validation and the leave-one-out validation (RF-code208581).


For the held-out validation that was repeated 100 times the result is here (100-times-repeated-split) and thea average of 100-time is: (average-metrics)

Feature Removal Analysis:
The feature removal results indicate the contribution of individual features (genes) to the model's performance. Metrics such as MCC, F1 Score, AUC, TPR, TNR, PPV, and NPV are used to evaluate the importance of each feature.
For the leave-one-out validation , the results were almost the same and there was just a little change in MCC value. Here is the average result for 100 times (leave-out-one).
The confusion matrix compares the predicted classes (SIRS-, Sepsis+) against the actual labels:
* True Negatives (SIRS-): 18 cases were correctly identified as SIRS-.
* True Positives (Sepsis+): Only 5 cases were correctly identified as Sepsis+.
* False Negatives: 10 Sepsis+ cases were incorrectly classified as SIRS-.
* False Positives: 4 SIRS- cases were incorrectly classified as Sepsis+.
Key Metrics:
* Accuracy (62.16%): Indicates overall correctness but is slightly better than the no-information rate (59.46%).
* Sensitivity (33.33%): The low sensitivity reflects difficulty in identifying Sepsis+ cases.
* Specificity (81.82%): High specificity shows the model effectively identifies SIRS- cases.
* Positive Predictive Value (55.56%): Indicates that about 56% of predicted Sepsis+ cases are correct.
* Negative Predictive Value (64.29%): Indicates that about 64% of predicted SIRS- cases are correct.
* Kappa (0.1618): Suggests poor agreement between predictions and actual classifications beyond random chance.
And based on MCC results for one-feature-removal validation this is the plot .
  

* Genes with shorter bars ( NLRP3, CD14, IFNA2):
   * These are more important for maintaining predictive performance.
   * Their removal results in the largest degradation of MCC, highlighting their importance.
* Genes with longer bars ( TNF, CXCL10, CXCL8):
   * These genes are less critical for the model, as their removal has little to no impact on MCC.
