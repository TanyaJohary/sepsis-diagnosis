# 🔬 Sepsis Diagnostics Project

This repository hosts a computational pipeline for identifying and prioritizing genetic biomarkers for sepsis using supervised machine learning, statistical analysis, and biological network interpretation. The project aims to support the development of robust diagnostic tools for sepsis through multi-dataset integration and rigorous biological validation.

## 📚 Project Overview

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Early diagnosis remains a major challenge due to its heterogeneous nature. This project explores gene expression data from multiple public datasets to discover consistent transcriptomic signals associated with sepsis, and to define a compact, interpretable diagnostic signature.

🎯 Key Objectives of this project:

🧪 Technical Objectives

Investigate multiple independent transcriptomic datasets from public GEO studies to identify reproducible sepsis biomarkers.

Apply rigorous statistical testing (Mann–Whitney U test, correlation filtering, effect size) to detect differentially expressed genes.

Use machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, stability ranking) for robust feature selection and model development.

Validate model generalizability across training datasets and assess biological coherence in independent external datasets.


🧬 Biological Objectives

Prioritize biologically relevant genes associated with innate immunity, immune suppression, and neutrophil activity.

Cluster gene signatures using protein–protein interaction networks (STRING) and enrich them through functional annotation tools (g:Profiler).

Interpret sepsis-related pathways to ensure biological relevance and coherence of the diagnostic gene signature.

## 🧠 Methodological Pipeline

The analysis pipeline involves the following stages:

### 🌲 1. Machine Learning Feature Selection
- **Random Forest**: Compute variable importance across multiple datasets.
- **Feature Importance**: Computed using Mean Decrease in Gini and validated with Leave-One-Feature-Out (LOFO) analysis.
- **Sanity check**: Assessed stability by injecting 10–50% synthetic noise into data.

### 🧮 2. Statistical Testing
- **Mann–Whitney U Test**: Evaluate differential expression between sepsis and control samples.
- **Effect Size Calculation**: Quantify biological relevance using Cohen’s d.
- **Rank Concordance**: Compared statistical rankings with machine learning scores using Spearman and Kendall correlation.

### 🧬 3. Signature Construction
- **Consensus Ranking**: Identified top 15 genes appearing in the top 25% across both RF and MWU rankings.
- **Cross-Dataset Aggregation**: Prioritized genes showing high recurrence across datasets.**

### 🔗 4. Biological Validation
- **STRING PPI Network**: Explore interactions networks of top genes and functional modules.
- **Functional Enrichment**: Annotated gene clusters using g:Profiler (g:GOSt).
