The goal of this project is to identify a genetic diagnostic signature from the scientific literature and to apply its list of genes, with machine learning, to microarray gene expression datasets to test its effectiveness.


The general idea is to repeat the analysis described the following article:


D. Chicco, T. Sanavia, and G. Jurman, "Signature literature review reveals AHCY, DPYSL3, and NME1 as the most recurrent prognostic genes for neuroblastoma". BioData Mining 16, 7 (2023).

The main steps are the following:




1) Signature detection. The student needs to look for published articles on wet-lab validated diagnostic signatures for sepsis, and to count the occurrences of the genes in these signatures.
The student needs to double-check the aliases of the genes found through g:Profiler’s g:Convert https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/convert 
Articles based on computational models should be discarded.
The output of this phase should be a list of genes known to be predictive of the diagnosis of sepsis.


2) Signature application. In this step, the student needs to look for microarray gene expression datasets of sepsis on GEO, and then to apply the designed signature to them.
In each dataset, the student needs to select only the columns related to the signature’s genes, and a target saying “healthy control” or “sick” for each patient.
The student needs then to first apply biostatistics tests such as Mann-Whitney U test to assess the association between each gene and the target column, and then machine learning methods such as Random Forests for the target prediction.
